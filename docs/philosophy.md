# Philosophy

This monorepo follows several key architectural and development philosophies to ensure maintainable, reliable, and scalable software.

## P1. Design by Contract (DbC)

We implement Design by Contract principles by:

- Defining clear preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
- Using explicit input validation and error handling
- Implementing comprehensive contract testing
- Documenting expected behavior and constraints

## P2. Functional Core, Imperative Shell

Our architecture separates:

- **Functional Core**: Pure functions with no side effects, easy to test and reason about
- **Imperative Shell**: Thin layer handling I/O, infrastructure, and side effects
- **Benefits**: Improved testability, reduced complexity, better error handling

## P3. Strangler Fig Pattern

For legacy system modernization:

- Gradually replace legacy components with modern implementations
- Maintain parallel systems during transition periods
- Route traffic incrementally to new implementations
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration

## P4. 12-Factor App Methodology

We adhere to 12-factor principles:

1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config**: Store config in the environment
4. **Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. **Port binding**: Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

## P5. Outside-In Development (ODD)

Our development approach:

- Start with user acceptance criteria and external interfaces
- Work inward from the outside APIs to internal implementation
- Focus on user value and system behavior first
- Implement infrastructure and details last

## P6. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

We practice BDD through:

- Writing acceptance tests in business language
- Collaborative specification development
- Living documentation that stays current
- Continuous validation of business requirements

## P7. Mikado Method

For large refactoring and architectural changes:

- Visualize dependencies and prerequisites
- Make small, safe changes iteratively
- Maintain system functionality throughout changes
- Use dependency graphs to plan complex transformations

## P8. Cohesion & Outcomes

These philosophies work together to create software that is:

- Maintainable and extensible
- Reliable and well-tested
- Aligned with business needs
- Easy to understand and modify
